# TEAM NAME: CIRCUIT BREAKERS
# ⏰ 24-Hour Digital Clock Using Discrete Logic ICs

A fully hardware-based **24-hour digital clock** built using **discrete CMOS logic ICs**. This project is being developed during a **2-Day Hackathon** and showcases digital clock design without using any microcontroller or programmable device.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a digital clock using **NE555 Timer** and **CD4026 Decade Counter/7-Segment Driver ICs**.

The entire clock is constructed using discrete electronic components, making it an excellent project for learning digital electronics, counters, clock generation, and sequential circuits.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a 24-hour digital clock using only discrete ICs.
- Generate clock pulses using the NE555 Timer.
- Count time using CD4026 decade counter ICs.
- Display time on seven-segment displays.
- Document the complete hardware development process.

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. The **NE555 Timer** generates a stable clock pulse.
2. The clock pulse is fed to the **CD4026** counter IC.
3. Each CD4026 counts incoming pulses and directly drives a seven-segment display.
4. Cascading multiple CD4026 ICs allows counting seconds, minutes, and hours.
5. Reset logic is implemented using discrete logic to achieve a 24-hour clock cycle.
